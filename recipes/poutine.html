<h2>Here we see my famous chicken poutine</h2>
<p>Chicken and poutine are two of my favourite things to eat. However, when you combine them you get best of both worlds!</p>
<h3>Ingredients needed to make chicken poutine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Russet potatoes</li>
<li>Chicken Legs</li>
<li>Poutine Gravy</li>
<li>White cheese curds</li>
</ul>
<h4><stronge>Now that we have our ingredients it is time to start cooking</stronge></h4>
<ol>
<li>Season and roast the chicken. It can take up to three hours to roast chicken legs, so be sure you have enough time to do so. Or, you can make the chicken ahead of time. After cooking, it will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
<li>Clean and slice the potatoes. For the best results, youâ€™ll want to cut the potatoes into long, thin slices. Peeling the potatoes is optional. To prevent the uncooked fries from turning brown, submerge them in a large container filled with cold water.</li>
<li>Make the poutine gravy. The best time to do this is while the chicken is roasting in the oven.</li>
<li>Shred the chicken. You can discard any chicken bones or skin.</li>
<li>Cook the French fries.</li>
</ol>
