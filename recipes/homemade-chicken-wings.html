    <h2>Take a look at my famous homemade baked chicken wings</h2>
    <p>Homemade baked chicken wings taste amazing. Plus an added bonus is that it is much healthier than fried chicken wings so you will not feel bad eating them.</p>
    <h3>The following items are needed to create my special homemade baked chicken wings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup yellow mustard</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>5 pounds chicken wings, cut into thirds and tips discarded</li>
        <li>Any sauce of your choice that you would like to coat the wings in or have on the side</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Since we have everything needed let's get to work</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix brown sugar, mustard, and soy sauce together in a bowl. Measure 1/4 cup marinade for basting and transfer to a small bowl; cover and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Place wings in a large resealable bag. Pour remaining marinade over wings, coating well; squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove wings from marinade, shake off any excess, and transfer them to a baking sheet. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Baste wings with reserved 1/4 cup marinade; cook, basting every 10 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Now for the final step you can coat the wings in the sauce of your choice or have the sauce you chose on the side</li>
    </ol>
