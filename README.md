Recipes project.
In this project i made a recipe page strictly using HTML. I have made only two git commits because it was a little difficult at first to get use to. However, through practice i got the hang of it. Furthermore, i also created links to get to a seperate page breaking down how to create the recipe then another link to go back to the homepage. Finally, i added a couple of pictures to help the viewers get an understanding of how the recipe should look.
